documentation: |-
    This block generates a sample correlation matrix for the input vector comprised of values drawn from the receive channels.
  
    Args:
    - inputs: Number of inputs to the block
    - snapshot_size: Determines num. of samples used to compute the sample correlation matrix
    - overlap_size: Overlap size between snapshots
    - avg_method: Use either standard forward-averaging method or a forward-backward averaging method to compute the sample correlation matrix.
